# Evaluating the Impact of Optional ACT and SAT Tests on Student Participation and Performance

This project aims to analyze the effect of making ACT and SAT tests optional on participation rates and scores, utilizing data from 2017, 2018, and 2019 versus 2021. In 2021, a majority of U.S. colleges made these tests optional, which instigated a significant shift in student participation and performance patterns. The project will explore whether the requirement of these tests was a primary determinant in student participation and if voluntary test-taking led to improved performance. The findings from this analysis will be utilized to assess the need for investing significant resources into these tests and explore the potential for focusing on alternative aspects of learning.

# Executive Summary

This project aims to evaluate the impact of making ACT and SAT tests optional on student participation rates and scores. With many colleges making these tests optional in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it provides a unique opportunity to assess whether the requirement of these tests influences student participation and if voluntary participation leads to improved scores.

The methodology involves a comparative analysis of data from 2017, 2018, and 2019 versus 2021, with particular emphasis on changes in participation rates and scores. Data sources include ACT and SAT test participation rates and scores, and information on college test requirements. The analysis will employ statistical testing and visualizations to discern any significant trends.

The key findings and insights from this project will help determine the ongoing value of investing in these tests and offer a more nuanced understanding of student motivation and performance in the context of standardized testing. This will, in turn, provide a basis for informed recommendations to the U.S. Department of Education about the future of ACT and SAT requirements.

The conclusions drawn from the findings will enable the U.S. Department of Education to make informed decisions about resource allocation and policy changes related to standardized testing. Future steps could include investigating other aspects of learning such as mindfulness practice for mental health and financial literacy that could be prioritized and exploring the impact of such changes on college admission outcomes.
